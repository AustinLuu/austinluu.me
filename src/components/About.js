            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Austin, a curious engineer interested in medical robotics, ml, and accessible tech â€” anything that can make technology work better for everyone. Currently, I'm based in Toronto, Canada studying Mechatronics Engineering @ryu.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, you can find me power lifting at the gym, shooting mediocre photos, or at your local beach playing volleyball! Recently, I've started a podcast on which I plan to talk more about some of my thoughts on tech and general musings about the world.</p>
